This semi final game took place in the first ever College Football Playoff between powerhouse Alabama and blueblood Ohio State. Many believed that Ohio State did not deserve to be in the playoff and would get destroyed by Alabama. This all time classic ended in an Ohio State win with one of the most iconic plays in the history of the game cementing the victory for Ohio State and catapulting them into the National Championship game that they would eventually win.

Points that were hard to come by, an iconic stadium with iconic teams in it, an unforgettable play call and controversy marked this remarkable installment of “The Game”.
