            <h1 class="header-msg">The greatest rivalry in sports is known simply as "The Game'. Ohio State and Michigan first met on a field in 1897 but the disdain between the two sides goes back farther than that. In 1835, Ohio and Michigan nearly staged a war with each other over the area of Toledo. The conflict included several skirmishes and while no one died, this conflict would set the stage for an ancient and heated rivalry. On the field, the rivalry has been almost even. The two prestigious programs have combined for 18 National Championships, 10 Heisman Trophy Winners, and almost 2000 total wins. Some of the famous events in this rivalry include The 10 Years War, The Game of the Century, and of course, The 2016 edition of The Game.</h1>

                <p class="para-color">The tide of the game had inarguably shifted toward Michigan. All game, Michigan had been able to drive the ball down the field and capitalize with points. On the other hand, Ohio State’s offense had struggled including two missed field goals and no points, Ohio State’s 7 points had come from a defensive score. With less than two minutes left in the third quarter, Michigan had the lead, at 17-14, and the ball. Ohio State needed a huge play from somewhere. As Michigan’s quarterback dropped back, he loaded up and threw a bullet right down the middle, right into the hands of star linebacker Jerome Baker. Through defenders, Baker wove down the field all the way into the 15. Ohio State had gotten its much needed turnover in the form of their second interception of the game.</p>

                <p class="para-color">The 2016 edition of The Game was an old school hard fought battle. Ohio State and Michigan came into this contest ranked 2 and 3 respectively. With 5:30 left in the game the score stood at 17-14 with Michigan ahead. Ohio State had struggled to generate offense the whole game but proceeded to drive down the field to set up a potentially game-tying field goal. Kicker Tyler Durbin had already missed 2 field goals and so lining up here at the end of the game, he was under more pressure than almost anyone else in the stadium.Durbin, however, easily made the field goal to force overtime. In the first half of overtime, both teams matched up with touchdowns and in the first game to go to overtime in this vaunted rivalry, it would go to double overtime. In double overtime Michigan would kick a field goal and give the ball back to Ohio State with an opportunity to win. After a crazy reverse and a controversial 4th down conversion, Curtis Samuel would take an end around in the touchdown to seal the win for Ohio State in the 113th edition of "The Game."</p>
