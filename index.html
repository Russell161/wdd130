        <p>I'm studying computer science. I love to play and watch sports. My favorite is whatever season it is so right now I like football and soccer a lot. </p>
        <p>In my family there are 8 of us, including my parents. I'm the oldest sibling of 6 kids, so I have 3 younger brothers and 2 younger sisters. My younger brother is currently serving a mission in California and the other 4 are still in school at home.</p>
        <p>I'm taking this class because I'm trying to figure out which field inside the realm of computer science I want to work in.</p>
