            <p class="msg-header">Is Whitewater Rafting Safe?</p>
            <p class="msg">As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
            Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>
